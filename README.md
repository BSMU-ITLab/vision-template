# Vision Template

This application serves as a template for developing custom applications using the Vision framework.

## Getting Started

### 1. Replace Placeholders:
- Change `orgname` to your organization’s name.
- Change `template` to your application’s name.
- Update the `pyproject.toml` file with your project’s specific details.
- Update the content of the `LICENSE` file to reflect your chosen license.

### 2. Namespace Package:
- This template creates a namespace package with `orgname` as the namespace.
  You can modify the template structure to create a regular package if needed.
